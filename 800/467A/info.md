George has recently entered the BSUCP (Berland State University for Cool
Programmers). George has a friend Alex who has also entered the university.
Now they are moving into a dormitory.

George and Alex want to live in the same room. The dormitory has _n_ rooms in
total. At the moment the _i_ -th room has _p_ _i_ people living in it and the
room can accommodate _q_ _i_ people in total (_p_ _i_ ≤  _q_ _i_). Your task
is to count how many rooms has free place for both George and Alex.

Input

The first line contains a single integer _n_ (1 ≤  _n_ ≤ 100) — the number of
rooms.

The _i_ -th of the next _n_ lines contains two integers _p_ _i_ and _q_ _i_ (0
≤  _p_ _i_ ≤  _q_ _i_ ≤ 100) — the number of people who already live in the
_i_ -th room and the room's capacity.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of rooms where George and Alex can move
