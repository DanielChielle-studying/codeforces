A soldier wants to buy _w_ bananas in the shop. He has to pay _k_ dollars for
the first banana, 2 _k_ dollars for the second one and so on (in other words,
he has to pay _i_ · _k_ dollars for the _i_ -th banana).

He has _n_ dollars. How many dollars does he have to borrow from his friend
soldier to buy _w_ bananas?

Input

The first line contains three positive integers _k_ ,  _n_ ,  _w_ (1 ≤  _k_ ,
_w_ ≤ 1000, 0 ≤  _n_ ≤ 109), the cost of the first banana, initial number of
dollars the soldier has and number of bananas he wants.

Output
