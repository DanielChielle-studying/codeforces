# C. Given Length and Sum of Digits...
You have a positive integer _m_ and a non-negative integer _s_. Your task is
to find the smallest and the largest of the numbers that have length _m_ and
sum of digits _s_. The required numbers should be non-negative integers
written in the decimal base without leading zeroes.

Input

The single line of the input contains a pair of integers _m_ , _s_ (1 ≤  _m_ ≤
100, 0 ≤  _s_ ≤ 900) — the length and the sum of the digits of the required
numbers.

Output

In the output print the pair of the required non-negative integer numbers —
first the minimum possible number, then — the maximum possible number. If no
numbers satisfying conditions required exist, print the pair of numbers "-1
-1" (without the quotes).
