# A. Chewbaсca and Number
Luke Skywalker gave Chewbacca an integer number _x_. Chewbacca isn't good at
numbers but he loves inverting digits in them. Inverting digit _t_ means
replacing it with digit 9 -  _t_.

Help Chewbacca to transform the initial number _x_ to the minimum possible
positive number by inverting some (possibly, zero) digits. The decimal
representation of the final number shouldn't start with a zero.

Input

The first line contains a single integer _x_ (1 ≤  _x_ ≤ 1018) — the number
that Luke Skywalker gave to Chewbacca.

Output

Print the minimum possible positive number that Chewbacca can obtain after
inverting some digits. The number shouldn't contain leading zeroes.
