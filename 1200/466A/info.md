# A. Cheap Travel
Ann has recently started commuting by subway. We know that a one ride subway
ticket costs _a_ rubles. Besides, Ann found out that she can buy a special
ticket for _m_ rides (she can buy it several times). It costs _b_ rubles. Ann
did the math; she will need to use subway _n_ times. Help Ann, tell her what
is the minimum sum of money she will have to spend to make _n_ rides?

Input

The single line contains four space-separated integers _n_ , _m_ , _a_ , _b_
(1 ≤  _n_ ,  _m_ ,  _a_ ,  _b_ ≤ 1000) — the number of rides Ann has planned,
the number of rides covered by the _m_ ride ticket, the price of a one ride
ticket and the price of an _m_ ride ticket.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum sum in rubles that Ann will need to
spend.

Note

In the first sample one of the optimal solutions is: each time buy a one ride
ticket. There are other optimal solutions. For example, buy three _m_ ride
tickets.
