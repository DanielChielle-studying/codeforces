# B. Fedya and Maths
Fedya studies in a gymnasium. Fedya's maths hometask is to calculate the
following expression:

(1 _n_ \+ 2 _n_ \+ 3 _n_ \+ 4 _n_)  _mod_ 5

for given value of _n_. Fedya managed to complete the task. Can you? Note that
given number _n_ can be extremely large (e.g. it can exceed any integer type
of your programming language).

Input

The single line contains a single integer _n_ (0 ≤  _n_ ≤ 10105). The number
doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Output

Print the value of the expression without leading zeros.
