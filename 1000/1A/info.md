# A. Theatre Square
Theatre Square in the capital city of Berland has a rectangular shape with the
size _n_ ×  _m_ meters. On the occasion of the city's anniversary, a decision

What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? It's allowed
to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square, but the Square has to be

should be parallel to the sides of the Square.
