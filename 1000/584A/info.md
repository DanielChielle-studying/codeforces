# A. Olesya and Rodion
Olesya loves numbers consisting of _n_ digits, and Rodion only likes numbers
that are divisible by _t_. Find some number that satisfies both of them.

Your task is: given the _n_ and _t_ print an integer strictly larger than zero
consisting of _n_ digits that is divisible by _t_. If such number doesn't
exist, print  \- 1.

Input

The single line contains two numbers, _n_ and _t_ (1 ≤  _n_ ≤ 100, 2 ≤  _t_ ≤
10) — the length of the number and the number it should be divisible by.

Output

Print one such positive number without leading zeroes, — the answer to the
problem, or  \- 1, if such number doesn't exist. If there are multiple
possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.
