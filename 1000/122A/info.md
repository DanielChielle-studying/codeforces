# A. Lucky Division
Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive
integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7.
For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky
number. Help him find out if the given number _n_ is almost lucky.

Input

The single line contains an integer _n_ (1 ≤  _n_ ≤ 1000) — the number that
needs to be checked.

Output

In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes), if number _n_ is almost
lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

    
    
    47  
    

Output

    
    
    YES  
    

Input

    
    
    16  
    

Output

    
    
    YES  
    

Input

    
    
    78  
    

Output

    
    
    NO  
    

Note

Note that all lucky numbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible
by itself.

In the first sample 47 is a lucky number. In the second sample 16 is divisible
by 4.
