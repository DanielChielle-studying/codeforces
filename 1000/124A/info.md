# A. The number of positions
Petr stands in line of _n_ people, but he doesn't know exactly which position
he occupies. He can say that there are no less than _a_ people standing in
front of him and no more than _b_ people standing behind him. Find the number
of different positions Petr can occupy.

Input

The only line contains three integers _n_ , _a_ and _b_ (0 ≤  _a_ ,  _b_ <
_n_ ≤ 100).

Output

Print the single number — the number of the sought positions.
