# A. Multiplication Table
Let's consider a table consisting of _n_ rows and _n_ columns. The cell
located at the intersection of _i_ -th row and _j_ -th column contains number
_i_ ×  _j_. The rows and columns are numbered starting from 1.

You are given a positive integer _x_. Your task is to count the number of
cells in a table that contain number _x_.

Input

The single line contains numbers _n_ and _x_ (1 ≤  _n_ ≤ 105, 1 ≤  _x_ ≤ 109)
— the size of the table and the number that we are looking for in the table.

Output

Print a single number: the number of times _x_ occurs in the table.
