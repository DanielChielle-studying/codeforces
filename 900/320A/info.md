A magic number is a number formed by concatenation of numbers 1, 14 and 144.
We can use each of these numbers any number of times. Therefore 14144, 141414
and 1411 are magic numbers but 1444, 514 and 414 are not.

You're given a number. Determine if it is a magic number or not.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer _n_ , (1 ≤  _n_ ≤ 109). This
number doesn't contain leading zeros.

Output

Print "YES" if _n_ is a magic number or print "NO" if it's not.
